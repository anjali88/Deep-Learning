# Deep Learning
This repo is the continuation of the Machine-Learning repo. Here I'm gonna to upload all the examples and exercises which I'll do to learn deep learning techniques and all the problems I'll solve using these last few.

### Disclaimer
- Tensorflow 2.0 is here! Check [HERE](https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha). Right now, most of the files in this repo are written using the old version of TF.
- Sometimes GitHub doesn't render properly the notebooks: if the load fails, go on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to see them.

### What are we talking about?
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.

### Why Deep Learning?
Deep learning has proven to outperform all other algorithms in a lot of situations. Of course, in some cases using it could be not only excessive but also a bad idea, so don't use it randomly (Random Forest and SVM, for example, are great models in many contexts).

##### BUT...
Deep Learning needs **A LOT OF DATA** and **A LOT OF COMPUTING POWER** to perform well.
That's why even if the idea behind NNs was developed in the '50s, they became so popular in the last years.

### How many types of Neural Networks exist?
More than you think, [HERE](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mostly-complete-chart-of-neural-networks-explained-3fb6f2367464) you can find a well explained list.
