# Sign Alphabet Recognizer

### Description
In this notebook I trained a CNN to recognize the letter of the sign language alphabet

### What did I use?

The main external libraries I used are linked below.

| Name | Link |
| ------ | ------ |
| Tensorflow 1.9.0 | https://www.tensorflow.org/
| Keras | https://keras.io/ |
| OpenCV | https://opencv.org/ |
| Numpy | http://www.numpy.org/ |

### Dataset
I downloaded the dataset from https://github.com/loicmarie/sign-language-alphabet-recognizer
Check it out, great work!

### Future improvements
The next step is to provide an interface to recognize the signs in real time, through a webcam.
